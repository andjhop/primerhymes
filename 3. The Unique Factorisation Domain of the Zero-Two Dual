The Unique Factorisation Domain of the Zero-Two Dual

Duals are Combos of two Singles, Tris are Combos of three Singles, Quads are Combos of four Singles
and so on. Singles are Integers "rebased" with a unique multiplicative structure and irreducibles
over a base b. The ring of Integers (Z, +, *) in this world is the "Zero" Single. A Dual of special
interest is the "Zero-Two" Dual which is a Combo of the "Zero" Single and the "Two" Single, it has
its own unique multiplicative structure and is a unique factorisation domain and thus has a
fundamental theory of arithmetic, further, it contains an infinitude of the irreducibles: {2, 3, 5, 11, 17...}.
