Rebasing Integers

Primes generate all other integers via multiplication.
Primes are fascinating, but we can build unique factorisation domains containing the integers with equally fascinating multiplicative structure
by making a choice about the residues of division we care about. If we care about residues of 0, we have a "single" with
base 0 which equivalent to the UFD of the integers and whose primes are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11...}, but we could also choose to
care about residues of 2, then we have a single of base 2, with a modified multiplication operation which also
generates the integers and whose primes are {2, 3, 5, 9, 11, 15...}; a of base 3, whose primes are
{2, 4, 8, 10, 14...}; and so on. We can even combine two singles of different bases to Create "Duals", or three to
create "Tris". The resulting objects also contain the integers and have fascinating multiplicative structure.
